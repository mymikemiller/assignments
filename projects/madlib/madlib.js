var story = `There I was is sitting at the ${n1} staring at my drink when a large, ${a1} biker steps up next to me, grabs my drink and gulps it down in one swig. 'Well, whatcha gonna do about it?' he says, ${av1}, as I burst into tears. 'Come on, man,' the biker says, 'I didn't think you'd CRY. I can't stand to see a ${n2} crying.' 'This is the worst day of my life,' I say. 'I'm a complete failure. I was late to a meeting and my boss fired me. When I went to the parking lot, I found my car had been stolen and I don't have any insurance. I left my wallet in the cab I took home. I found my old lady in bed with the gardener and then my dog bit me. So I came to this bar to work up the courage to put an end to it all, I buy a drink, I drop a capsule in and sit here watching the poison dissolve; then you, you jack-ass, show up and drink the whole thing! But enough about me, how's your day going?`
