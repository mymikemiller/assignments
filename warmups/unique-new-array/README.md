Unique new Array()

The title of this is supposed to be a play on the tongue twister "Unique New York" but that's pretty hard to decipher. So check out that video for laughs instead.

Write a function that takes 2 arrays for parameters and returns a new array with only the items that are unique to each new array.

console.log(findUniques([1, 2, 5], [1, 2, 8, 9, 10]));  // [5, 8, 9, 10]  
Extra credit
Write the function so that it could take any number of arrays passed to it, not just necessarily 2.
