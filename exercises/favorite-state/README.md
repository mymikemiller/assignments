Exercise - Angular Routing Basics
Favorite State
You are going to build a simple Angular app that talks about your favorite state. You will be using Angular routes (ngRoute).

You must:

Build HTML from scratch
Use Bootstrap grid to lay out page nicely
Have a home page that:
Shows an image of the state flag
Has the name of the state
Have an about page that:
Has background info about the state (you can use Wikipedia)
Shows the current population
Have a whyilove page that:
Shows 5 images of that state (ie California surfer, Wisconsin cheese, rolling hill of Texas, etc)
Your app will have a single module / ng-app
Each page will have its own html template, route and controller
Your default page/route will be the home page
Your index.html page must have clickable links for each page so the user can navigate between pages
