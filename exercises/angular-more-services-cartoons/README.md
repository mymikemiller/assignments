Exercise - Angular - More Services!!

Time to nail down services!!! You will build a website that shows a list of images (and their titles and descriptions) of old school Cartoon Network characters.

Requirements
Build HTML from scratch (no cheating and copying your Ugly Things work!)
Use Bootstrap to style buttons and input fields
Have 3 input fields:
1 that takes an image url
1 that takes an image title
1 that takes an image description
Will have a button that submits the user input
Have a service in a separate file that:
Stores the list of cartoon objects
Has an addCartoon() function that adds a new cartoon to the list. This function will take one parameter, which represents a single cartoon instance.
Your controller will not define any new arrays in it - (remember: the cartoon list is stored in your service!)
Your input fields and button must be centered on the screen and look nice.
You will have at least 2 pleasing colors on the screen (one for the header/input fields and one for the content)
You can use this tool to find colors if you like: https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/
